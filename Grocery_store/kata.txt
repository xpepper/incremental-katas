Welcome to the grocery store! We have some modern cash registers equipped with an
interface to a read-only memory (ROM) containing daily sales information. 
Through this interface, we can collect sales reports from all the tills at the end of each day. 
A script connects to the registers and reads the daily transactions, generating a Record of Sales (ROS) file. 
This ROS file includes the item name, quantity sold, and the total price paid for each item.

We compile all these ROS files and email them for manual processing by our accountant, Mr. Bean C. Ounter. 
As part of our expansion plan to open 30 new grocery stores, we'll team you up with Mr. Bean to facilitate his work.

Your initial task is to write a program that reads ROS files and calculates the grand total income for each ROS file.

Below, you'll find the contents of an example ROS file:
