# TODO

- [R?] CategorizedRecordOfSales extends from RecordOfSales?
- [F?] compute grand total income (GTI) from multiple ROS files
- [F?] shall we avoid writing a report with categories with no sales? (e.g. `bread: 0`)
- [F?] quantity should be > 0
- [F?] price should be NOT negative (discounts? 0 is allowed?)
